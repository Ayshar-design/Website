      <p>Baliangao is a coastal town located in the province of Misamis Occidental, Philippines. The name Baliangao was derived from the Cebuano phrase balay sa langaw meaning “house of flies”. According to folk tales, the place was called as such because of the multitude of flies living off the decomposing fish which just lay on the beach. Baliangao has a long and storied history that dates back to pre-colonial times. The town was originally settled by the Subanon people, an indigenous group that has lived in the area for thousands of years. In the 16th century, Spanish explorers arrived in the region and established a settlement in the nearby town of Oroquieta. During the American colonial period, Baliangao was established as a municipality in 1918.</p>
